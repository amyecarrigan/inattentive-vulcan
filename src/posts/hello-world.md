Mr. Vulcan and I have been taking [30x500](https://30x500.com/academy/) (spoiler alert, it's _awesome_), and one of the first steps they tell you to take is to set up a blog with a newsletter sign up. Against their recommendation, I decided to build a blog using Vue.js. They recommend using WordPress because of its ease of set up, and getting out of the way. Because that's what I do for my day job, I wanted to try to branch out and do something different. I've also been struggling to make time to learn [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Two birds, one stone, and this blog was born.

Well, sort of. Like any birth, there was a lot of struggle and a little screaming during the process.

I figured someone had tried this, so I searched around for a tutorial to get started. Voila! A tutorial on [how to build a blog platform](http://baljeetsingh.in/blog/running-vue-js-2-0-creating-simple-blog-application-709/) and learn Vue.js in the process.

About half-a-dozen half-baked attempts into this process, and CSS Tricks published [an article on building a Vue.js blog](https://css-tricks.com/the-rise-of-the-butt-less-website/) that included how to import posts through Markdown.

This tutorial also took a few attempts while I tried to figure out how to write SCSS my way (meaning in its own file, and not in the Vue components). Look, I've been doing web development for a long time, I just want to write it this way, okay? _Get off my lawn._

Anyway, we're here now, and this will be place to capture my ramblings about front-end web development, my learnings in animation (and probably some illustration), and whatever else seems relevant at the time.

Pull up a chair, sign up for the newsletter if you want an email when I post a new post (roughly weekly). (RSS may be coming soon, we'll see if I get around to building that part.)

Drop me a line at hello [at] inattentivevulcan [dot] com to say 'Hello'. I've been off Twitter for a while, I'll probably post here when (if) I decide to come back.
